### Programming with ESP IDF

![ESPidf](images/ESPidf.JPG)

In some cases where you need maximum performance, improved compatibility, and low overhead, you might want to use the native SDK. ESP-IDF is Espressif's official development SDK for the on-board ESP32-WROOM32 module. ESP-IDF also helps you understand what is happening under the hood. Through a simple step-by-step process to illustrate how to use ESP-IDF(Espressif IoT Development Framework).

#### What You Need?

To develop applications for ESP32 you need:
* PC loaded with either Windows, Linux or Mac operating system
* Toolchain to build the Application for ESP32
* ESP-IDF that essentially contains API for ESP32 and scripts to operate the Toolchain
* A text editor to write programs (Projects) in C

#### Preparation for development

There are three simple steps in the process of development:

* **Setup of Toolchain**
* **Getting of ESP-IDF from GitHub**
* **Installation and configuration**

**Step 1: Setting up the toolchain**

Windows don’t have a built-in “make” environment, so as well as installing the toolchain you will need a GNU-compatible environment. We can use the MSYS2 environment to provide this environment. The quick setup is to download the Windows all-in-one toolchain & MSYS2 zip file from dl.espressif.com: [Toolchain Setup- Windows](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp32_win32_msys2_environment_and_toolchain-20180110.zip)

The quick setup is to download the linux all-in-one toolchain from Espressif website:[Toolchain Setup 64-bit Linux](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz) and [Toolchain Setup 32-bit Linux](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux32-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz)

The quick setup is to download the ESP32 toolchain for macOS all-in-one toolchain from Espressif website:[Toolchain Setup macOS](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-osx-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz)


**Step 2: Getting ESP-IDF**

Besides the toolchain (that contains programs to compile and build the application), you also need ESP32 specific API / libraries. They are provided by Espressif in [ESP-IDF repository](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html). To get it, open terminal, navigate to the directory you want to put ESP-IDF and clone it from espressif repository in github.


**Step 3: Setting up**

To set up the software environment and get esp-idf follow the instructions by clicking  [Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/windows-setup.html), [Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html), [Mac OS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/macos-setup.html).
